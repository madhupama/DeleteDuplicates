Notes  : 
      Maven Project includes pom,java & junit files, the junit testcases as part of build as per continuous integration standards.
      The DeDup.java is also providing the main method so as to be run as java application, just for execution flexibility only (as this is not standard practice). 
      Assuming jdk 1.8 env., equivalent code also provided if running in lower jdks kept in disabled mode.
      every method lists the pros and cons in the comments section above the method signature.
