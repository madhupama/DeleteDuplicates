Notes  : 
      1.Maven Project includes pom,java & junit files, 
      the junit testcases added as part of continuous integration standards.
      2.The DeDup.java is also providing the main method so as to be run as 
      java application, just for execution flexibility only. 
      3.Assuming jdk 1.8 env., equivalent code also provided if running in lower jdks kept in disabled mode.
      every method lists the pros and cons in the comments section above the method signature.
